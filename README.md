# Project-template-05

For this project I am making a space shooter. The basic idea is a mix of galaga and asteroids.
You can control the player ship with the mouse and click to fire the weapon. You move across 
the bottom of the screen to protect your space station. Destroy all of the meteors to win the 
level and get as many points as you can. In future updates I would love to add multiple additions 
to this project. Some things added would be powerups, bonus ships and enemy ships that attack you.
This is just a fun relaxing game that I made for my class. Please leave any feedback to help me out
with future work. Below are the asset packs that I used.
